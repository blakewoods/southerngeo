# Website - Southen Geo

A simple static website built in HTML and CSS.

### Why?

We needed a website, just to show off some of our cool stuff.

### Results

I suppose this speaks for itself!

### Features

- Use of Zero-MD for showing off document pages, like this one.
- Use of AirTable for things like forms for quotes, etc.

### Use

Just a simple, basic website that's easy to get around.

### Wrap Up

There's really not much to this, have a look at some other things in the [portfolio](/portfolio) for more cool stuff.
