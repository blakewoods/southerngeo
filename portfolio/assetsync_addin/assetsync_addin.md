# ArcGIS Pro - TechnologyOne Asset Editor Add-in

A integrated ArcGIS Pro Add-in for TechnologyOne

### Why?

The client currently uses TechnologyOne for their asset management and tracking software, and ArcGIS Pro for geospatial analysis and tracking.

The main reason for this software being built was because there was no currently available add-ins that did the required functions of editing, creating and viewing TechnologyOne data within ArcGIS Pro.

### Results

The results was a successful add-in that functions natively within ArcGIS Pro.
Editors can now easily edit, create and view details of assets from TechnologyOne within ArcGIS Pro.

### Features

- Always On Top toggle, to stop it from getting lost on your desktop.
